## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze the sales performance of a retail chain using various key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit margin, and customer demographics. The insights derived from this analysis help in understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and regional performance to make informed business decisions.

## 2. Data Overview
The dataset consists of sales transactions with attributes such as:

Product Name,Month,City,Total Sales,Profit Margin,Customer Count,Category (Furniture, Electronics) and Gender Distribution

## 3. Key Findings

3.1 Sales by Category

The total sales are divided into two main categories: Furniture and Electronics.

Furniture accounts for 45.11% of total sales, while Electronics contributes 54.89%.

3.2 Customer Demographics

Male customers account for a higher percentage of purchases compared to female customers.

Gender distribution insights can help in targeted marketing strategies.

3.3 Regional Sales Performance

Sales are distributed across multiple cities, including Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and Rewa.

The sales distribution map provides a geographical representation of revenue concentration.

3.4 Monthly Sales Trend

January recorded the highest total sales.

There was a sharp decline in February, followed by a slow recovery in subsequent months.

Understanding these patterns can help in inventory and sales forecasting.

3.5 Sales by Product Name

Chairs had the highest total sales.

Headphones, Smartphones, Laptops, and Tables followed in decreasing order of sales.

Product-specific insights are essential for demand planning and inventory management.

## Question 

1. Load the sales dataset into Power BI.
2. Clean and transform the data by removing null or erroneous entries.
3. Create relationships between tables (e.g., Sales, Products, Customers, Regions).
4. Create a sales trend line for the past 12 months.
5. Generate a bar chart showing top 10 products by revenue.
6. Create a map visualization of sales by region.
7. Develop a pie chart of sales distribution across product categories.
8. Use DAX to calculate the total sales and total profit for each product.
9. Build a slicer to filter data by year and quarter.
10. Create a KPI card to display total revenue, profit margin, and customer count.
11. Analyze customer demographics (e.g., age groups, gender distribution).
12. Identify the least-performing regions and their contributing factors.
13. Develop a dashboard summarizing sales trends, key products, and regional

## 5. Recommendations

Increase Inventory for High-Demand Products: Since chairs have the highest sales, maintaining adequate stock can optimize revenue.

Targeted Marketing by Gender: Since male customers have higher purchase rates, promotional campaigns should be tailored accordingly.

Enhance Regional Strategy: Rewa shows a high concentration of sales; expanding presence in similar cities could be beneficial.

Improve Product Mix: Electronics have slightly higher sales than furniture, indicating a balanced product portfolio is essential.

## 6. Conclusion

Leveraging these insights can help in strategic decision-making, enhancing revenue generation, and optimizing business operations. Further analysis with more data points can improve prediction accuracy and business efficiency.
