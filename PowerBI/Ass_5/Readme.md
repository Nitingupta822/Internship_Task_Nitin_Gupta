### **5. Dashboard Analysis**
#### **5.1 Category Analysis**
- The dashboard categorizes equipment into six main categories.
- **Diagnostic and Imaging equipment** account for the highest cost and quantity.
- **Laboratory and Therapeutic equipment** have moderate distribution.
- **Monitoring and Surgical categories** show a balanced distribution.

#### **5.2 Manufacturer Analysis**
- The pie chart highlights that **no single manufacturer dominates the market**, ensuring a diversified procurement strategy.
- Equipment is evenly distributed among multiple manufacturers, with no manufacturer exceeding 6% share.

#### **5.3 Purchase Date Trends**
- Equipment purchase patterns show spikes in **2017, 2020, and 2023**, suggesting major procurement cycles.
- Seasonal and budget-based procurement trends are visible.

---

### **6. Insights and Recommendations**
- **Optimize Procurement Strategy:** Since purchases peak every 3-4 years, hospitals should plan bulk purchases to negotiate better pricing.
- **Diversify Suppliers:** A wide range of manufacturers contributes to the inventory. It is advisable to compare supplier reliability and cost-effectiveness.
- **Monitor High-Cost Equipment:** The **top five high-cost equipment** should be regularly assessed for ROI and utilization.
- **Predict Future Purchases:** Using Snowflake’s **predictive analytics**, hospitals can forecast the next peak procurement period and budget accordingly.
